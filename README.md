# Tracking System for Domestic Animals based on ARM Cortex M3

This project introduces a tracking belt for domestic animals, employing an ARM Cortex M-3 microcontroller, SIMCOM GSM, and UBLOX NEO 6M GPS. The system tracks animal locations, monitors environmental conditions, and communicates data to a remote receiver via GSM. Key features include power-efficient operation, battery monitoring, temperature sensing, and continuous tracking updates. The project aims to enhance animal safety, facilitate quick retrieval, and contribute to animals behavior studies through real-time monitoring and data collection
